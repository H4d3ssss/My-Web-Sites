    <h1>Sinigang ni Ralffie</h1>
    <p>
        Sinigang ni Ralffie isn’t just a dish—it’s a hug in a bowl! Sour, savory, and packed with all the good stuff,
        this
        recipe takes the classic Filipino sinigang and gives it Ralffie’s special touch. Imagine tender meat swimming in
        a
        tamarind broth that makes your face do that happy-asim reaction, with veggies that stay fresh and crunchy. It’s
        the kind
        of ulam that makes rice disappear faster than you realize. Whether it’s raining outside or you just need a taste
        of
        comfort, Sinigang ni Ralffie will always hit the spot—masarap, maasim, at punong-puno ng pagmamahal!
